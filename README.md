[Read our preprint here: Revising the ortholog conjecture in cross-species comparison of scRNA-seq data (v3)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.06.21.600109v3)


#### Steps include:
 - Gene classification using scRNA-seq data and the [GeneSpectra](https://github.com/Papatheodorou-Group/GeneSpectra) module
 - Plotting of gene classes (pie chart or bar chart) in one species
 - Cross-species orthology mapping
 - Cross-species ortholog gene class conservation analysis (gene class conservation heatmap)
 - Cross-species cell type conservation of genes in different classes (pie charts)
 - Comparing sequence similarity (bit score) and expression specificity similarity

#### Datasets include:

 - Primate MTG data (5 species)
 - Embryogenesis data (2 species)
 - Cnidarian data (4 species)
